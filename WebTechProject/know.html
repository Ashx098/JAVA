		Dexterous industrial manipulators and industrial vision have roots in advanced robotics work conducted in artificial intelligence (AI) laboratories since the late 1960s. Yet, even more than with AI itself, these accomplishments fall far short of the motivating vision of machines with broad human abilities. Techniques for recognizing and manipulating objects, reliably navigating spaces, and planning actions have worked in some narrow, constrained contexts, but they have failed in more general circumstances.
