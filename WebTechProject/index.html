			<h1><u><b>Robots -The Future of Humans</b></u></p></h1>
			<p>
				What Is Robotics? Robotics is the intersection of science, engineering and technology that produces machines, called robots, that substitute for (or replicate) human actions. Pop culture has always been fascinated with robots.
				here has been a study that the number of robots will increase over the next decade, and about 25% of the human labor work will be performed by robots. This will possible because of the reduction in the manufacturing costs and improvement in the overall performance<br><br>
				Will we have robots in 2050?<br>
Most homes will have a home robot by about 2050, Musk agrees with the interviewer, though improving artificial intelligence (A.I.) remains the key stumbling block.
Not only are robots able to work with better accuracy, which reduces the amount of time and materials wasted, they can also work faster (and longer) than humans can. While this can have an adverse impact on the jobs that people rely on, it also, by lower manufacturing costs, makes the price of goods cheaper.

		<h1>We are here to progress into the world of AI</h1><br>
		<p>AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. The tasks that constitute AI are:

			<h3>What are robots?</h3>
			<p>Robot, any automatically operated machine that replaces human effort, though it may not resemble human beings in appearance or perform functions in a humanlike manner. By extension, robotics is the engineering discipline dealing with the design, construction, and operation of robots. humanoid robot.</p>
		</div><br>
		<div class="courses">
			<h3>Why do we need robots?</h3>
			<p>Robots eliminate dangerous jobs for humans because they are capable of working in hazardous environments. They can handle lifting heavy loads, toxic substances and repetitive tasks. This has helped companies to prevent many accidents, also saving time and money.</p>
		</div><br>
		<div class="courses">
			<h3>What are different types of robots?</h3>
			<p>1. Articulated Robots
An articulated robot is the type of robot that comes to mind when most people think about robots. Much like CNC mills, articulated robots are classified by the number of points of rotation or axes they have. The most common is the 6-axis articulated robot. There are also 4- and 7-axis units on the market.<br><br>
2. SCARA Robots
A Selective Compliance Articulated Robot Arm (SCARA) is a good — and cost-effective — choice for performing operations between two parallel planes (e.g., transferring parts from a tray to a conveyor). SCARA robots excel at vertical assembly tasks such as inserting pins without binding due to their vertical rigidity.<br><br>
3. Delta Robots
Delta robots, also referred to as “spider robots,” use three base-mounted motors to actuate control arms that position the wrist. Basic delta robots are 3-axis units but 4- and 6-axis models are also available.<br><br>
4. Cartesian Robots
Cartesian robots typically consist of three or more linear actuators assembled to fit a particular application. Positioned above a workspace, cartesian robots can be elevated to maximize floor space and accommodate a wide range of workpiece sizes.

		<h1> Our Achievements </h1>
		<p>In India a few research groups have been working in the development of robots but a break through is yet to be made in the field of robots for large-scale industrial application. The groups working on robotics include R & D of the Hindustan Machine Tools (HMT), the Central Machine Tools Institute (CMIT), the Indian Institute of Technology, Madras, the Indian Institute of Science of Bangalore and the Hyderabad Science Society, Hyderabad.

The public sector defense production unit, Bharat Electronic Limited (BEL) was the first Indian Industry to introduce an indigenously developed robot in its production line. It introduced a Tick and Place’ type with a three- axis movement in its television tube production plant at Bangalore. The pneumatically operated robots were incorporated to improve the productivity, maintaining ability in the semi- automated plant, eliminating operator fatigue and other health hazards controlled by microprocessor.
<br><br>
Robots continued to develop and can now be found in homes as toys, vacuums, and as programmable pets. Today robots are a part of many aspects of industry, medicine, science, space exploration, construction, food packaging and are even used to perform surgery.
Not only are robots able to work with better accuracy, which reduces the amount of time and materials wasted, they can also work faster (and longer) than humans can. While this can have an adverse impact on the jobs that people rely on, it also, by lower manufacturing costs, makes the price of goods cheaper.
